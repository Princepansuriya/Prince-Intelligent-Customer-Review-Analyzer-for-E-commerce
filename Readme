🧪 How It Works
1️⃣ Upload Review File

Upload CSV → ak-customer-datareview S3 bucket
This triggers the Lambda ingestion function.

2️⃣ Processing Pipeline

Lambda:

Reads each row of the CSV

Cleans empty records

Calls Comprehend

Generates sentiment & key phrases

Writes processed data to DynamoDB (batch-write)

3️⃣ Summarization

A second Lambda:

Reads all reviews from DynamoDB

Sends combined text to SageMaker endpoint

Stores final summary back in DynamoDB

4️⃣ Visualization

QuickSight loads data from:

DynamoDB result export (CSV) OR

S3 exported file
